# Summary

[Shiny](http://http://shiny.rstudio.com/) [@shiny] is an [R](https://r-project.org) package for developing web applications without HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. As Shiny increases in popularity so has the complexity of the Shiny apps built. In many instances, new-users will require instructions when they first use a Shiny application. 

[Intro.js](http://introjs.com) [@introjs] is a JavaScript library that helps integrate step-by-step introductions into websites. The `rintrojs` R package integrates Intro.js into Shiny, so that users can easily add instructions to their application without having to use JavaScript.
