With the advent of the **Shiny** [@shiny] package, *R* is now a popular platform for developing data-driven web applications. As **Shiny** increases in popularity, so will the complexity of the apps built with it. In many instances, new-users will require guidance when they first use a **Shiny** application. Ideally, there would be a way for authors to articulate to users how their application should be used. 

Luckily, there is already a well established *JavaScript* library for this purpose. **Intro.js** [@introjs], written by Afshin Mehrabani, is a **JavaScript** library that builds step-by-step introductions, and clickable hints into websites. The **rintrojs** package [@rintrojs] integrates **Intro.js** into **Shiny**, so that users can easily add instructions to their applications without having to use HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.
